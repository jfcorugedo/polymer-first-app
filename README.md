Example TODO list application using web components (Polymer 1.5.0 implementation).

It uses the most recent version of Polymer and it follows all the recomendations made for this version.

In addition to Polymer, it uses [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/) asincronous system to dispatch tasks between all people connected.

In order to integrate those systems, [PubNub polymer element](https://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-polymer) has been used.
