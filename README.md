# polymer-first-app

![Polymer Logo](https://www.polymer-project.org/images/logos/p-logo.png)

Example TODO list application using web components (Polymer 1.5.0 implementation).

It is based on [this](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-real-time-polymer-to-do-app) tutorial. However it uses newer Polymer features and fixes some mayor bugs present in the original application.

In addition to Polymer, it uses [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/) asincronous system to dispatch tasks between all people connected.

In order to integrate those systems, [PubNub polymer element](https://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-polymer) has been used.
